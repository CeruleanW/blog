## Chinese Translation 

照樣差你——恩典必成就凱旋，
超越黑暗、與陰間、地獄、罪愆
承担我名，也奉靠我名去征服 ——
照樣差你，看我勝利在前

照樣差你——去體恤受困靈魂
真理之光，要被擄的得釋放
除去罪孽 的束縛與死亡枷鎖
照樣差你，喚迷途歸我旁

照樣差你——軟弱中見我力量
苦中見樂，痛切中更見安寧
恩典、權柄、我的臨在都要見證
照樣差你，結出不敗果實

照樣差你——恆心地背上十架
終有一天，將欣然卸下勞苦
得蒙嘉許：「我忠僕使命已完成
來吧同享 我寶座、冠冕、國度！」

「正如天父已差了我，照樣差你。」

## Original English version

So send I you – by grace made strong to triumph,
O'er hosts of hell, o'er darkness, death, and sin,
My name to bear, and in that name to conquer-
So send I you, my victory to win.

So send I you - to take to souls in bondage
The word of truth that sets the captive free,
To break the bonds of sin, to loose death's fetters-
So send I you, to bring the lost to me.

So send I you - my strength to know in weakness,
My joy in grief, my perfect peace in pain,
To prove My power, My grace, My promised presence-
So send I you, eternal fruit to gain.

So send I you - to bear My cross with patience,
And then one day with joy to lay it down,
To hear My voice, "well done, My faithful servant-
Come, share My throne, My kingdom, and My crown!"

(Coda)
"As the Father hath sent Me, so send I you."
